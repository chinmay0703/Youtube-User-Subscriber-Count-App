1) The HTML and CSS for the Impactshaala landing page have been completed.

2) EJS and Node.js files have been created, with an Express app set up. EJS dependencies have been downloaded, and server-side rendering is functioning correctly. Two files, "static" and "pages," have been created. The "static" file contains the navbar and footer, while the "pages" file includes the homepage. However, there is an issue where the Tailwind CSS is not being applied to the content.

3) CSS implementation for the components and division of the landing page content into different sections are tasks that still need to be completed.
